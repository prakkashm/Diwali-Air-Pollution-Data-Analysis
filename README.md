# Geoscience Data Analysis - Diwali after effects on Delhi Air Pollution
- Gathered some insights about Delhi Air pollution (for the given week period) from the dataset.
- The dates for the dataset have been strategically chosen to show the effect of Diwali on the air pollution in Delhi.
- Implemetation of Geostatistical techniques for interpolation like Variograms and Kriging.
- Interpolation: Estimating unknown data point (values) with the help of already known data points.
- Kriging: A type of interpolation originated from and generally used in geoscience.
- Using Kriging on a Delhi Air Pollution dataset to predict estimate pollutant concentration values.

## Refer to the presentation for the analysis.
